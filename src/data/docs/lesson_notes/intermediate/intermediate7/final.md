**CONCEPTS**
1. Expressing reasons/excuses something couldn't be done
    1. Forms
        1. A/V + -아/어서, -기 때문에, -(으)니까
        2. V + -느라고(=느라) : Because (of)
    2. Rules
        1. It expresses the fact that the action in the preceding clause continued to occur simultaneously with an action in the following clause.
            - Ex: 회의가 있었어요. + 한국어 수업에 못 갔어요. => 회의하느라 한국어 수업에 못 갔어요.
        2. TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS MORE: The clause that follows –느라고 sounds unnatural for a clause that is positive to follow it. 
        Ex) 친구를 만나느라고 기분이 좋아요. (X)
                -> 친구를 만나서 기분이 좋아요. (O)
        3. TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS MORE: it is used a lot with verbs such as 고생하다 and 수고하다.
            Ex) 일하느라고 수고하셨어요.
                돕느라고 고생하셨어요. 
        4. The subject must be the same in the both clauses.
            Ex) 나는 공부하느라고 존은 파티에 못 갔어요. X
        5. Future tense or past tense can’t be used together.   
            Ex) 공부했느라고(or 공부하겠느라고) 친구를 못 만났어요. X
        6. Propositive and imperative form can’t follow –느라고.
        7. The verb as 알다, 모르다 can’t be used. – Action verb is OK
            Ex) 모르느라고…X
