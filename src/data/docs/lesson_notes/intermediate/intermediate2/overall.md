   - 고민 is more something you're concerned about and trying to figure out a solution/alternative or make a decision
      - e.g. youre busy but you need to fit something else in, youre trying to figure out how to make it work
   - 걱정 is more of a feeling, if you have anxiety about something or discomfort. 
      - e.g. Someone isnt answering their phone and youre worried about it
