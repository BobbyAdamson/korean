Here is the course plan with a rubric for the speaking part. Our teacher tends to be generous with the precise rules of it

Of the main conversation scripts we have in our lessons, I bet we're looking at some combination of the following for speaking:
1. Describing your device (what kind of smart phone, apps you would recommend, how long you had it etc)
2. Technical problems with your phone / Calling a clerk - these were studied separately but theyre so similar that I bet they end up being one conversation with a clerk e.g. whats wrong with your phone? would you like to repair it? How long will it take? etc
3. I could see the following being asked separately or together in order to cover changes/difficulties because they both have to do with things changing
    3a. Daily routine changes (e.g. since corona how has your life changed?)
    3b. A big part of the rubric is about difficulties of living abroad, but in place of that in class she asked us difficulties of learning korean/what was hard and how is it now?
